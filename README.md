# Image-Gallery
This is a Image Gallery web app built using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript. This app uses Pexel's API to fetch images from Pexel's server. This is one of my finest project.   

You can search the about topics on the search bar and hit the **üîç** or press **Enter** to search. This app supports infinite scrolling. So keep scrolling. The right most button with symbol *O* is to change the orientation of the images. Try it.
